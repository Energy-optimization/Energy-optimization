# Energy Optimization

This repository focuses on **energy optimization infrastructure** in **RAN (Radio Access Networks)** environments.  
It integrates various components including rApps, O1/VES adapters, and a 5G core to create a modular, testable energy optimization stack aligned with O-RAN and SMO frameworks.

### 1. Clone the Repository with Submodules
```
$ git clone https://github.com/Energy-optimization/Energy-optimization#
$ cd Energy-optimization
```

---

### 2. Install Submodules and Their Dependencies

---

#### 2.1 openairinterface5g

Follow the official [OAI installation guide](https://gitlab.eurecom.fr/oai/openairinterface5g) for complete build instructions.

**Quick Start Example:**
```
$ cd openairinterface5g
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install -y build-essential cmake libboost-all-dev
```
Then follow the instructions in \`openairinterface5g/README.md\`.

To run the gnb config file along with telnet-o1 server, use the below command
```
$ sudo ./nr-softmodem -E -O ../../../targets/PROJECTS/GENERIC-NR-5GC/CONF/gnb.sa.band78.fr1.106PRB.usrpx310.conf --sa --telnetsrv --telnetsrv.shrmod o1
```
---

#### 2.2 o1-adapter
```
$ cd o1-adapter
```
- To install using Docker:
```
$ ./build-adapter.sh --adapter
```
- To configure and run the O1 adapter with the NetConf server:
```
$ ./start-adapter.sh
```
---

#### 2.3 smo-o1

```
$ cd smo-o1
```

Install and run the SDN controller:
```
$ ./sdnr.sh
```
---

#### 2.4 smo-ves
```
$ cd smo-ves
```
Follow the official documentation:  
üìé [https://github.com/o-ran-sc/smo-ves](https://github.com/o-ran-sc/smo-ves)

This includes installation of:
- VES Collector
- InfluxDB Connector
- Grafana
- Additional dependencies

---

#### 2.5 performance-aware-rApp
```
$ cd performance-aware-rApp
```
